# Customer_Churn_Prediction
## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data and building predictive models to identify customers who are likely to churn. By leveraging data-driven insights, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to minimize churn and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is data_Customer_Churn.csv, which contains the following information about customers:

  - Demographic details

  - Account information

  - Services subscribed

  - Churn status

## Notebooks

The analysis and modeling process is documented in the Customer_Churn.ipynb notebook. This notebook includes:

  - Data preprocessing and exploration

  - Feature engineering

  - Model training and evaluation

  - Results and insights

## Key Features

  - Data Visualization: Understand customer churn patterns through insightful plots.

  - Machine Learning Models: Compare multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

  - Performance Metrics: Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
